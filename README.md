OpenMATB is an open-source - under a GPL license - version of the Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB)


Since almost twenty years have passed since the last iteration of the MATB implementation (Comstock & Arnegard, 1992), different requirements for up to date research are no longer satisfied.
More precisely, OpenMATB promote three aspects: 
(1) tasks customization for full adaptation of the battery,
(2) software extendability to easily add new features, 
(3) experiment replicability to provide significant results.


The software is licences under GPL-2
